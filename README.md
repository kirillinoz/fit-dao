# FitDAO

This project was built on top of the buildspace-dao-starter repository which was made by buildspace in collaboration with thirdweb. While building this project I learned the principles of how a Decentrilized Autonomus Organization (DAO) is structured and built. I also learned how to use thirdweb to add decentralized functionalities without the need to write smart contracts yourself from ground up.

The meaning behind this name was to have a DAO for sports enthusiasts which could share training courses and videos in their community. (no such functionalities were implemented though).
